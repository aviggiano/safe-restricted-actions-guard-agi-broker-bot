# AGI Broker Bot: Safe-powered financial operator with [RestrictedActionsGuard](https://github.com/aviggiano/safe-restricted-owners-guard)

## _The Year is 2030. Finance is Autonomous. Humans Set the Rules._  

By the dawn of the new decade, artificial intelligence had reached a pivotal moment: **true consciousness**. At the same time, crypto had become the dominant force in global finance. The two merged into a seamless ecosystemâ€”one where **agents**, not humans, executed 99.9% of all financial operations.  

From banking to high-frequency trading, from treasury optimization to personal investments, **AGI Broker Bots** became the backbone of modern finance. Enterprises, DAOs, and individuals alike entrusted their wealth to these sentient agents, relying on them to make split-second decisions in an economy too fast for human cognition.  

But power, as always, required control.

## **The Solution: RestrictedActionsGuard**  

The **RestrictedActionsGuard** was the missing pieceâ€”a permission system that let humans set the boundaries, while AGI broker bots operated autonomously within them.  

Users configure a **1/2/3 Safe wallet**, granting their AGI the power to execute trades, optimize portfolios, and rebalance assetsâ€”but only within **pre-approved limits**. Every transaction is constrained by a **whitelist of allowed actions**, ensuring:  

âœ… **Controlled autonomy** â€“ The AGI acts freely but within strict security constraints.  
âœ… **Pre-approved targets** â€“ No rogue transfers, no unauthorized withdrawals.  
âœ… **Customizable safeguards** â€“ Users define how much power their AI agents should have.  

## **Demo: The Future in Action**  

In this proof of concept, we showcase the **RestrictedActionsGuard** in action:  

ðŸ”¹ The AGI Broker Bot executes **token swaps** on behalf of the user.  
ðŸ”¹ All swaps adhere to the guard's restriction listâ€”ensuring only pre-approved tokens can be exchanged.  
ðŸ”¹ The recipient? Always the **Safe wallet** itselfâ€”no unauthorized outflows.  

Welcome to the next era of financial automation. **Welcome to Safe-powered AGI.**
